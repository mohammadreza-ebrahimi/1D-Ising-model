# 1D-Ising-model

In this repo, I have investigated the 1D-Ising model in order to predict the interaction between spins by utilizing 
**scikit learn**.  

Machine learning could be a very useful tool in physics, here I have used it and built 2 regression models ***Ridge*** and ***LASSO*** that predicts the Hamiltonian and after that visualize the parameter **J**. 

The pure ***scikit learn*** method has been provided in `.py`  file and the more about the theoretical parts of Ising model can be found in ***jupyter notebook***.
