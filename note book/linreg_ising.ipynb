    "## Learning Goal\n",
    "> Let us now apply linear regression to an example that is familiar from Statistical Mechanics: the Ising model. The goal of this notebook is to revisit the concepts of in-sample and out-of-sample errors, as well as $L2$- and $L1$-regularization, in an example that is more intuitive to physicists. \n",

    "$$H[\\boldsymbol{S}]=-J\\sum_{j=1}^L S_{j}S_{j+1}$$\n",

    "on a chain of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions and $S_j=\\pm 1$ Ising spin variables. In one dimension, this paradigmatic model has no phase transition at finite temperature. \n",

    "### Learning the Ising model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose your boss set $J=1$, drew a large number of spin configurations, and computed their Ising energies. Then, without telling you about the above Hamiltonian, he or she handed you a data set of $i=1\\ldots n$ points of the form $\\{(H[\\boldsymbol{S}^i],\\boldsymbol{S}^i)\\}$. Your task is to learn the Hamiltonian using Linear regression techniques. "

To make the analogy complete, we can also represent the dot product by a single index $p = \\{j,k\\}$, i.e. $\\mathbf{X}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{J}=X^i_pJ_p$. Note that the regression model does not include the minus sign, so we expect to learn negative $J$'s."
